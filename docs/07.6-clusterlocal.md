# Cluster local services

So far, we've been deploying publicly accessible services. In this lab, we'll create a private/cluster-local service that is not accessible from outside the cluster. You can read more on private cluster-local services in the [docs](https://knative.dev/docs/serving/cluster-local-route/).

## Deploy the private Knative service

Create a [service-local.yaml](../serving/helloworld/service-local.yaml) file.

```yaml
apiVersion: serving.knative.dev/v1alpha1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: helloworld-local
  namespace: default
  labels:
   serving.knative.dev/visibility: cluster-local
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
        # Replace {username} with your actual DockerHub
        - image: docker.io/{username}/helloworld:v1
          env:
            - name: TARGET
              value: "v1"
```

Notice how we labeled our service with `cluster-local`. This makes the service private. 

Deploy the service:

```bash
kubectl apply -f service-local.yaml
```

## Check that service is local

You can check that service is private:

```bash
kubectl get ksvc helloworld-local

NAME               URL
helloworld-local   http://helloworld-local.default.svc.cluster.local
```
Notice that the URL has `svc.cluster.local` (and not our dummy nip.io domain) in it which makes it not publicly accessible.
