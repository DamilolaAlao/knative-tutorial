# Pub/Sub triggered service

In this sample, we'll take a look at how to connect GCP Pub/Sub messages to a service with Knative Eventing.

## GCP PubSub event source

Follow the [GCP Cloud Pub/Sub source](https://knative.dev/docs/eventing/samples/gcp-pubsub-source/) docs page to set Knative Eventing with GCP Pub/Sub up until where you need to create an event display. We'll create our own event display and trigger to connect to it.

Before you continue, you need to make sure GCP PubSub source is setup:

```bash
kubectl get pubsub

NAME                                            READY   REASON   AGE
pubsub.events.cloud.google.com/testing-source   True             52s

NAME                                                      READY   REASON   AGE
pullsubscription.pubsub.cloud.google.com/testing-source   True             52s
```

## Consumer

For the event consumer, we can use the Event Display service in [Hello World Eventing](helloworldeventing.md) sample. Go through the steps mentioned there to create and deploy the Event Display service. 

## Trigger

Let's connect the Event Display service to the Broker with a Trigger. 

Create a [trigger-event-display-pubsub.yaml](../eventing/pubsub/trigger-event-display-pubsub.yaml):

```yaml
apiVersion: eventing.knative.dev/v1alpha1
kind: Trigger
metadata:
  name: trigger-event-display-pubsub
spec:
  subscriber:
    ref:
      #apiVersion: serving.knative.dev/v1
      apiVersion: v1
      kind: Service
      name: event-display
```

Create the trigger:

```bash
kubectl apply -f trigger-event-display-pubsub.yaml

trigger.eventing.knative.dev/trigger-event-display-pubsub created
```

Check that the trigger is ready:

```bash
kubectl get trigger

NAME                           READY   REASON   BROKER    SUBSCRIBER_URI                                   AGE
trigger-event-display-pubsub   True             default   http://event-display.default.svc.cluster.local   95s
```

## Test the service

We can now test our service by sending a message to Pub/Sub topic:

```bash
gcloud pubsub topics publish testing --message="Hello World"

messageIds:
- '198012587785403'
```

Wait a little and check that a pod is created:

```bash
kubectl get pods
```

You can inspect the logs of the pod (replace `<podid>` with actual pod id):

```bash
kubectl logs --follow <podid>
```

You should see something similar to this:

```text
Event Display received message: Hello World
```
